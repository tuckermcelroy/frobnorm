R code, scripts, and data for "Model Identification via Total Frobenius Norm of Multivariate Spectra"

## Contents
Some of the routines rely on the Ecce Signum R package, which is bundled here in sigex-master.zip.  
There are five scripts to run different analyses in the paper:
1. ScriptUChidi.r runs the simulations in Section 4.2.
2. ScriptRankTest.r runs the simulations in Section 4.3.
3. ScriptModelEval.r runs the simulations in Section 5.2.
4. ScriptPCE.r runs the data analysis in Section 7.1.  Also the files PCECore86.txt and PCETotal86.txt are needed.
5. ScriptStarts.r runs the data analysis in Section 7.2.
Note: please change paths in the beginning of the scripts to match your own system.
